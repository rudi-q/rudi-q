## 💻 Tech Stack & What Makes Me Different

### **Languages I Ship With**
**Dart/Flutter** • **TypeScript** • **Python** • **Rust** • **JavaScript**

I've been writing Dart for 5+ years and have shipped production apps with millions of interactions. Python and TypeScript are my go-to for rapid prototyping and backend work. Rust is newer but I've shipped two real products with Tauri.

### **How I Build Products**
**Frontend:** Flutter (mobile), SvelteKit (web), React, Astro, Chrome Extensions  
**Backend:** Node.js, Python (Flask/FastAPI), Supabase, PostgreSQL  
**Desktop:** Tauri (Rust), cross-platform native apps  
**Systems:** Canvas API, WebGL, custom rendering engines

### **Privacy & Performance Engineering**
This is what sets my work apart. I don't just build features, I build products people can trust:
- **Zero-knowledge encryption** and end-to-end security
- **On-device ML inference** with TensorFlow Lite (no data ever leaves the device)
- **Sub-50ms response times** through aggressive optimization
- **Privacy-first architecture** from day one, not bolted on later
- **Offline-first design** so your data stays yours

### **Data & ML**
**Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, TensorFlow Lite, on-device inference, synthetic data generation  
**Data Analytics:** Statistical analysis, predictive modeling, A/B testing, user behavior analysis  
**Business Intelligence:** Market analysis (15%+ product launch success improvement), data-driven decisions

My CS degree specialized in Data Analytics, and I apply it to actual product decisions, not just dashboards.

### **What I'm Known For**
- Building products that respect user privacy while delivering ML-powered features
- Performance optimization (60fps on mobile, <50ms server response)
- Cross-platform development (one codebase, native feel everywhere)
- Shipping fast without breaking things

## 💡 Philosophy & Approach

> *"The products I build come from personal frustration. If I'm annoyed by something, chances are thousands of other people are too."*

**My approach:**
- **Privacy isn't negotiable**: Your data belongs to you, not on someone's server
- **Speed creates trust**: When software responds instantly, people actually enjoy using it
- **Simple beats clever**: The best solution is the one people understand immediately
- **Done beats perfect**: Real feedback from real users beats endless internal debates

**How I build:**
- I write code that's easy to understand and maintain, because six months from now, I'll be that confused person trying to figure out what I was thinking
- I believe in thorough testing at every stage. Shipping fast doesn't mean shipping recklessly
- Good documentation isn't extra work, it's how you help future contributors (including yourself) hit the ground running
- Accessibility isn't a feature you add later. If it's hard to use for someone, it's not done yet
